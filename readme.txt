In late 2024 I decided 2025 would be the year I begin to ramp myself back up into programming and Computer Science, both by consuming educational
material, but also by actually programming - initially solving Leetcode problems as a good way of refreshing on data structures and algorithms, as
well as the syntax of different languages. I've chosen two languages to focus on - Python3 and Rust, to give me a good mix of fast and scrappy, and
high level and high performance.

Here are some problems I would like to solve, I will add to this as more problems come to mind.

Problems:
- Existing Problems Solved in Python also solved in Rust
- Recursive Towers of Hanoi
- Problem 5 using an optimal speed method
