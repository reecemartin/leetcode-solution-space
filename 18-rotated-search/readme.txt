Problem:
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 5000
    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
    All values of nums are unique.
    nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
    -104 <= target <= 104

Solution:
This one was not too bad, the intuition I had was basically that we still have the binary property we just need to find the
one spot that violates it, which happens to be in the segment of the array that has a larger violation. This one had a bunch
of edge cases that I had to hack around, so I could improve a bunch by cleaning things up. 

Solution beats 68% on speed and 13% on memory.
