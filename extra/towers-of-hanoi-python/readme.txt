In a first year programming course one task we had was writing a recursive program to solve towers of hanoi. I am not sure I ever actually did it, so
I wanted to come back and write a solution to make sure I knew how, and fortunately I do! It's pretty simple of course and I thought it through
on the rowing machine before writing the code afterwards.
